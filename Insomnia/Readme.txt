Description / Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stand alone version of Pokopom's "Prevent Screensaver" option.

Simply start it and change the settings if necessary. Press the button or the
X to close the program.

Mode: Display, forces the display to be on and System, forces the system to be
on. This alone however, won't prevent a screensaver.

No screensaver option, starts/stops a thread that sends a bogus mouse event
every... 50 seconds? or so to reset the screesaver counter. This might also
prevent other programs from setting "idle" status.

The settings should be active as soon as selected/changed.
