Description / Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stand alone version of Pokopom's "Prevent Screensaver" option.

By default, just starting the application will be enough.


Settings
--------

Mode - System / Display Required: In theory, should avoid sleep of the system
and display respectively. See link 1 for more info.

Mode - Bogus Mouse Even: Sends a null mouse event on each loop (59 seconds) to
reset the idle counters. Effectively avoiding the screensaver from showing up.

Run on Startup: Creates a user registry entry to run Insomnia from its current
location on each start.

Whitelist: The checkbox enables/disables the usage of the whitelist, and can
also create and load a new one if there was none loaded.

When the button is enabled, the whitelist file (Insomnia.whitelist)
has been loaded.
